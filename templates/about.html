    <h1>ü¶ç About Guerilla Camping</h1>
    <p>For those who live outside the box. We're not your typical camping site.</p>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Guerilla Camping is for the rebels, the van lifers, the off-grid enthusiasts, and anyone who doesn't fit the traditional mold. We're veterans, nomads, and people who choose to live differently.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To provide real, authentic advice about camping, gear, and living off-grid from someone who actually does it. No fluff, no BS - just straight talk from the trenches.</p>
    <h2>The Guerilla Philosophy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Live outside the box</li>
      <li>Question everything</li>
      <li>Find your own path</li>
      <li>Use technology to stay free</li>
      <li>Make money while living your dream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
    <p>Most camping sites are written by people who go camping once a year. We're written by someone who lives this lifestyle 24/7. That's the difference between theory and reality.</p>
    <h2>Our Gear Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We only recommend gear that we've actually used and tested in real-world conditions. If it doesn't work in the field, we don't recommend it. Simple as that.</p>
    <h2>Affiliate Transparency</h2>
    <p>Yes, we use affiliate links. But here's the deal - we only promote products we actually use and believe in. The commissions help keep this site running and allow us to test more gear.</p>
