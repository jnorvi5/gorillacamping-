        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Jon, an Army veteran turned guerilla camping enthusiast living in 
            Danville, Virginia. After years of following someone else's rules and living someone 
            else's dream, I decided to take life into my own hands and live it <em>guerilla style</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's where "Gorilla Camping" was bornâ€”a play on the word "guerilla" because I believe 
            in resourcefulness, grit, and making the most out of what you have. Whether you've got 
            $50 or $500, there's a way to get outdoors and live free.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Guerilla Camping?</h2>
        <p>
            This isn't your typical family-friendly camping blog. It's a little rough around the edges, 
            real, and honestâ€”like that crazy uncle at the barbecue who has the most interesting stories 
            because he chose to do things his own way.
        </p>

        <p>I'm building this for:</p>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Army vets like myself</strong> who have a pension or disability and are looking for a place to fall into</li>
            <li><strong>People who know how to make a little go a long way</strong> and want the freedom of not being tied to a mortgage</li>
            <li><strong>Anyone tired of the conventional path</strong> and ready to live life on their own terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p>
            This site is more than just gear reviews and camping tips (though I've got plenty of both). 
            You'll find real talk about:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Living off-grid on a budget</li>
            <li>Gear that actually works (not just expensive stuff)</li>
            <li>Alternative lifestyle choices</li>
            <li>Growing your own food (including legal cannabis and mushroom research)</li>
            <li>Building a sustainable income while living free</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Virginia Setup</h3>
        <p>
            I'm currently going to school at WGU while building this guerilla camping empire from 
            Danville. I grow my own food (including some legal cannabis and mushrooms for "research purposes" 
            ðŸ˜‰), test gear in the Virginia wilderness, and document everything for the tribe.
        </p>

        <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
        <p>
            I'm looking for a tribe of like-minded adventurers, hustlers, and dreamers to join me as 
            we figure this out together. This isn't just about camping gear or affiliate marketing 
            (though I'll share some great finds!)â€”it's about embracing the guerilla mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's about finding freedom, building something from scratch, and supporting each other along 
            the way. My goal is to turn this passion into $1,000+ per month while helping others do the same.
        </p>
