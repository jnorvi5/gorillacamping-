        <h1>Guerilla Terms & Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>
        <p class="legal-tagline">
            <strong>Real talk, no BS.</strong> Here's exactly how Gorilla Camping operates.
        </p>

            <h2>üéØ The Guerilla Affiliate Reality</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Straight up:</strong> Some links on this site are affiliate links. That means if you buy something 
                after clicking my link, I might earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps keep the lights 
                on and the gear reviews coming.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>But here's the thing:</strong> I only recommend gear I actually use, test, and believe in. 
                No fake reviews, no paid placements, no BS. If it's on this site, it's because it earned its place 
                in my pack or helped me survive in the Virginia wilderness.

        <div class="disclaimer-card">
            <h2>üì¶ "AS-IS" Product Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                All product recommendations are provided <strong>"AS-IS"</strong> based on my personal experience. 
                Your mileage may vary because:
            </p>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li>Every camper has different needs and budgets</li>
                <li>Gear performs differently in different conditions</li>
                <li>What works in Virginia might not work in Alaska</li>
                <li>Product quality can change over time</li>
                <li>I'm not responsible if you buy something and it doesn't work for you</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Legal Guerilla Stuff</h2>
            <h3>Affiliate Partnerships</h3>
            <p>
                I participate in affiliate programs including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program</strong></li>
                <li><strong>REI Co-op Affiliate Program</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Other outdoor gear retailers</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Product Testing & Reviews</h3>
            <p>
                Unless specifically noted, I purchase all gear with my own money. Sometimes manufacturers 
                send me products to test, but that never influences my honest opinion. If I hate it, 
                you'll know. If I love it, you'll know that too.
            </p>

            <h3>Earnings Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                Any income or earnings statements are estimates only. Your results will vary. There's no 
                guarantee you'll make any money from camping, affiliate marketing, or anything else 
                mentioned on this site. I'm sharing my journey, not promising yours will be the same.
