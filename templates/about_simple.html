    <h1>ABOUT GUERILLA CAMPING</h1>
    <p>Real talk from someone who's actually lived it</p>

        <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
        <p>I'm Jon, an Army veteran and off-grid enthusiast. I live in Virginia, grow my own food (including some legal cannabis for "research purposes" ðŸ˜‰), and test gear in the real wilderness.</p>
        
        <h2>THE MISSION</h2>
        <p>Gorilla Camping is about living free, camping smart, and hustling for a better lifeâ€”on a shoestring budget. I share guerilla-style camping tips, brutally honest gear reviews, and the real story of building a blog and affiliate income from scratch.</p>
        
        <h2>THE GOAL</h2>
        <p>Turn this passion into $1,000+ per month while helping others do the same. This isn't just about camping gear or affiliate marketingâ€”it's about embracing the guerilla mindset.</p>
